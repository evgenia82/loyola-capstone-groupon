#### Project Title
Identify Trends in Customer Refund data

#### Project Description

**Problem Statement:**
Today's online shopping experience is often supplemented by consumers sharing their purchases and opinions on social channels. With social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook bringing in increasing amounts of traffic, possessing high refunds rates can quickly apply negative connotation to our image. As a result, our operations team is continually challenging our e-commerce goals, working with the global data science teams to make sure we can more accurately identify new ways to solve our most common customer pain points.
So we seek to understand: What is driving refunds? What refund sub-buckets are driving the majority of refunds? Any seasonality trends? How can we improve  the CS experience to reduce refunds? Simply put, if you can reduce refunds and returns, you can make money!

**Goals:**

The goal of this project is to understand refund at category level, identify root causes, identify trends by employee and allow us to model how much savings we can achieve by reducing the current refund rates by 50%.

**Data:**

Data will be provided upon acceptance of this project along with a data dictionary. Year 2016-2019 data will be provided from Groupon Operations team. Data will be encoded with fake categories and names for privacy reasons.

#### Project Expectations
The final deliverable of this study will allow us to explore profitability, refund rates, refund errors, employee profitability, and various performance metrics over time.
